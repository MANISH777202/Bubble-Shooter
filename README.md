Terraform AWS Application Migration
This project automates the migration of an application to AWS using Terraform. It provisions essential cloud resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 storage, making the deployment process efficient and repeatable.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that Terraform is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Terraform website. Additionally, install the AWS CLI and configure it using aws configure to set up your access credentials. You will also need an AWS IAM user with sufficient permissions to create and manage cloud resources.

Setup and Deployment
To begin, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Initialize Terraform by running terraform init, which sets up the working directory and downloads required provider plugins. Before applying changes, use terraform plan to preview the infrastructure changes Terraform will make. Once reviewed, execute terraform apply and confirm the action by typing "yes" when prompted. This will create the necessary AWS resources as defined in the Terraform configuration files. You can then verify the deployment by checking the AWS Management Console.

If your application requires manual setup on the EC2 instance, SSH into the server using ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip. From there, you can install dependencies, transfer application files, and start the necessary services.

Terraform Ignore Files
To prevent tracking of unnecessary or sensitive files, create a .terraformignore and .gitignore file in your project directory. These should exclude .terraform/, *.tfstate, *.tfstate.backup, terraform.tfvars, and terraform.tfvars.json. This ensures that private configuration files and Terraform state files are not mistakenly committed to version control.

Destroying Resources
If you need to remove all AWS resources created by Terraform, execute terraform destroy. Confirm the action by typing "yes" when prompted. This will safely delete the infrastructure, ensuring no lingering costs or resources remain.

Next Steps
To further enhance your infrastructure, consider adding a load balancer for high availability, using RDS for managed database services, and configuring IAM roles for improved security. With Terraform, infrastructure management becomes streamlined, making it easier to scale and manage your application in AWS. ðŸš€
